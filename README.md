# Lambdish Compiler
Lambdish is a compiled functional programming language inspired on other functional languages such as Racket and Haskell. It's main purpose is to provide a simple experiece of functional programming, while keeping complexity at a minimal. Thus, it is meant to be an introduction to the functional world for programmers of other paradigms.

## Features
Below are some of the main characteristics of the language
* Statically typed: Lambdish is a statically typed language and thus types are well defined and checked at compile time. 
* Strongly typed: Operation type checking at compile time, and inmutability allows for easier programming .
* Simple data types:
  * Numbe (num): Any numberic value wether integer or float, positive or negative.
  * Character (char): Any alphanumeric element.
  * Boolean (bool): Classic boolean value, true or false.
* More complex data types: 
  * Arrays: Lambdish supports arrays of any of the forementioned types, as well as array types. Thus, allowing for nested arrays of any level.
  * Functions: As a functional programming language, functions can be used as data types. The specific type of a function is defined by it's parameters and return type.
* Lambda functions: Complete support for anonymous functions and higher order functions.
